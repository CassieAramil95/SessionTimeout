# SessionTimeout

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.0-rc.4.


After logging in with the right credentials (u: username p:pass), it will navigate you to the home page where the session timeout logic lives. After being idle for 10 seconds, a pop up shows up giving you the option of continuing or logging out. If you don't take any action it will log you out. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
